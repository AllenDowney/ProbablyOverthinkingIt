    "In 1889 Joseph Bertrand posed and solved one of the oldest paradoxes in probability.\n",
    "But his solution is not quite correct -- it is right for the wrong reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original statement of the problem is in his *Calcul des probabilités*, Gauthier-Villars, 1889.\n",
    "As a testament to the availability of information in the 21st century, I found a [scanned copy of the book online](https://books.google.fr/books?id=IDo7AQAAIAAJ) and pasted a screenshot into an online OCR server (optical character recognition).\n",

    "> Trois coffrets sont d'apparence identique. Chacun a deux tiroirs, chaque tiroir renferme une médaille. Les médailles du premier coffret sont en or; celles da deuxième coffret, en argent; le troisième coffret contient une médaille d'or et une médaille d'argent. On choisit un coffret; quelle est la probabilité pour trouver, dans ses tiroirs, une pièce d'or et une pièce d'argent? Trois cas sont possibles et le sont également puisque les trois coffres sont d'apparence identique. Un cas seulement est favorable. La probabilité est 1/3.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Le coffret est choisi. On ouvre un tiroir. Quelle que soit la médaille qu'on y trouve, deux cas seulement restent possibles. Le tiroir qui reste fermé pourra contenir une médaille dont le métal diffère ou non de celui de la première. Sur ces deux cas, un seul est favorable au coffret dont les pièces sont différentes. La proba-bilité d'avoir mis /a main sur ce coffret est donc 1/2.\n",

Cent contiennent deux médailles d'or, cent deux médailles d'argent et cent une médaille d'or et une médaille d'argent. Dans chaque coffret on ouvre un tiroir, on voit par conséquent trois cents médailles. Cent d'entre elles sont en or et cent en argent, cela est certain ; les cent autres sont dou-teuses, elles appartiennent aux coffrets dont les pièces ne sont pas pareilles : le hasard en réglera le nombre.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">On doit s'attendre, en ouvrant les trois cents draies, à y voir moins de deux cents pièces d'or la probabilité pour que la pre-mière qui se présente appartienne à l'un des cent coffrets dont l'autre pièce est en or est donc plus grande que 1/2."
