# Probably Overthinking It

This site contains the Jupyter notebooks I used in my preparation of *Probably Overthinking It: How to Use Data to Answer Questions, Avoid Statistical Traps, and Make Better Decisions*, University of Chicago Press, 2023.

Before you read these notebooks, please keep in mind:

* Many of the examples will not make sense unless you have read the corresponding chapter in the book.

* In the process of preparing these notebooks, I've made some changes to improve the readability of the code. There might be small differences between what appears in the book and what you get when you run this code.

**Chapter 1**

[Run the code from Chapter 1 on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ProbablyOverthinkingIt/blob/book/notebooks/gaussian.ipynb)

[Run the code that cleans the BRFSS data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ProbablyOverthinkingIt/blob/book/notebooks/clean_brfss.ipynb)

[Run the code that cleans the Big Five data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ProbablyOverthinkingIt/blob/book/notebooks/clean_big_five.ipynb)
