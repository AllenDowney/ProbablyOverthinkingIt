# Probably Overthinking It

This site contains the Jupyter notebooks I used in my preparation of *Probably Overthinking It: How to Use Data to Answer Questions, Avoid Statistical Traps, and Make Better Decisions*.

The book is scheduled to be published by University of Chicago Press in 2023.

Before you read these notebooks, please keep in mind:

* There is some explanatory text in the notebooks, but some of the examples will not make sense until you have read the corresponding chapter in the book.

* While preparing these notebooks, I made some changes to improve the readability of the code. There might be small differences between what appears in the book and what you get when you run the code.
